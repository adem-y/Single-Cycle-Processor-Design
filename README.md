The project was designed in Quartus Prime environment using SystemVerilog and simulated with ModelSim. We designed a single rhythm processor based on a simplified instruction set. Project is made by 4 steps: Instruction Fetch, Instruction Decode, Execute Unit and finally Single Cycle Processor which includes this three part.
I didn't add the whole files for the project, just RTL codes and TestBenchs.
